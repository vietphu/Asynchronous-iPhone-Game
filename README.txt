=========================
Asynchronous Game Library
=========================

This project is meant to be a relatively simple "drop in" set of files for implementing 
"asynchronous", or "turn by turn" online gameplay.

The sample iPhone project will eventually contain examples of the following features:
- creating a new server "account"
- creating a new game and choosing players via email
- getting a game list from the server
- taking turns in a game, which includes:
   - download of previous turn data from the server
   - upload of new turn data to the server
- getting a push notification when it is your turn (via urban airship)

This project also includes a server component.
