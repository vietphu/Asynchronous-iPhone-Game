To use the Asynchronous Game Library, follow these instructions.


 === Step 1: Basic Setup ===

a. Copy the AGL folder and files into your application.



 === Step 2: Register URL Scheme ===

Notes: If you have already created a URL Scheme for your app, you may skip this step.
       Optionally, you may want to register your App's url here: http://handleopenurl.com/


a.  Edit your Info.plist file.
b.  Add a row with "URL Types" as the key.
c.  Expand Item 0, and edit the URL Identifier.
        By convention, this should probably be a reverse domain name (example: com.domain.appname)
d.  Right click on Item 0, and add another row, this time with key "URL Schemes". Expand it,
        and for its Item 0, enter the string that will be your app's protocol. 
        (example: to use myapp:// you would enter "myapp".)
e.  Save your Info.plist, that's it!


 === Step 3: Modify your App Delegate ===

a.  Open your App Delegate implementation file (.m), and add the following near the other #import statements:

#import "AGLSetup.h"

b.  Add the following method (usually after your applicationWillTerminate definition):

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
	return [[AGLStart sharedAGLStart] handleOpenURL:url];
}
